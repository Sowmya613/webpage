<h2><center>INTRODUCTION</center> </h2><hr align="center" width=100%>
    <p>  <font color="white"> <li> A codebase (sometimes spelled as two words, code base) is the complete body of source code for a given software program or application.  </li></font></p>

    <li> <font color="white"> Source code is the version of a program that a programmer writes and saves as a file.</font></li>
    <li> <font color="white">After the code is compiled preparatory to running on a computer, the program exists as object code, which the computer understands but a human cannot without a great deal of difficulty.</font></li>
    <li> <font color="white">The source code is retained, either as a collection of files or in a source control repository, so that changes can be made as necessary throughout the software's supported life.</font></li>
    <li> <font color="white">Codebase management really starts with the creation of the code in the first place.</font></li>
    <li> <font color="white">The quality of the programming, adherence to best practices and adequate commenting can make the codebase much easier to maintain.</font></li></font><hr color="black" align="center" width=80%>
<h3>  <center>DISTINCT AND MONOLITHIC CODEBASE </center></h3><hr align="center" width=100%>
<p><li> <font color="white">Multiple projects can have separate, distinct codebases, or can have a single, shared or monolithic codebase.</font></li>
<li> <font color="white">This is particularly the case for related projects, such as those developed within the same company.</font></li>
<li><font color="white"> In more detail, a monolithic codebase typically entails a single repository (all the code in one place), and often a common build system or common libraries.</font>></li>
<li> <font color="white">Whether the codebase is shared or split does not depend on the system architecture and actual build results; thus, a monolithic codebase, which is related to the actual development, does not entail a monolithic system, which is related to software architecture or a single monolithic binary.</font>></li>
<li> <font color="white">As a result, a monolithic codebase may and (for large codebases) often will consist of separate components, instead of carrying only a single system or single binary; a distributed codebase (with multiple components) can be used to build a single monolithic system or even a single binary.</font>></li>
<li> <font color="white">For example, the Linux kernel is architecturally a single monolithic kernel, but it consists of separate binaries (loadable components), and is developed in multiple distributed repositories.</font></li>

<p>
<li><font color="white">There are both advantages and disadvantages to a monolithic codebase, when it is compared to a distributed codebase.</font></li>
<li><font color="white">Most simply, a monolithic codebase simplifies integration—changes to different components or refactoring of code between components can be done easily and atomically—and allows operations across the entire codebase, but requires a larger repository and makes it easier to introduce wide-ranging technical debt.</font></li>
<li><font color="white">A separate codebase or a distributed codebase keeps individual repositories smaller and more manageable, enforcing at the same time separation between components, but it also requires integration between codebases (or with the main repository), and complicates changes that span multiple codebases.<font color="white"></li>
</p>
<p>
    <font color="white">In terms of standards, referring to multiple codebases as "distinct" declares that there are independent implementations without shared source code and that, historically, these implementations did not evolve from a common project. This may be a way of demonstrating interoperability by showing two independent pieces of software that implement a given standard.[dubious – discuss]</font><hr color="black" align="center" width=80%>

<h4><center> EXAMPLES </center></h4><hr align="center" width=100%>
<p>
    <font color="white">Some notably large codebases include:</font></p>
<p>
    <font color="white">Google: monolithic, 1 billion files, 9 million source code files, 2 billion lines of source code, 35 million commits in total, 86 TB total size (January 2015)</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font color="white">Facebook: monolithic, 8 GB (repo 54 GB including history, 2014),[6] hundreds of thousands of files (2014)</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font color="white">Linux kernel: distributed, over 15 million lines of code (as of 2013 and kernel version 3.10)</font><hr color="black" align="center" width=80%>
